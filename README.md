# SoleMate Technical Documentation

## Introduction

SoleMate is an intelligent fall prevention system developed as a hackathon prototype that demonstrates AI-powered fall prediction using wearable sensor technology. Built in 48 hours, this system represents a novel approach to senior safety by focusing on **prevention rather than reaction**.

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional medical alert systems that only activate after a fall has occurred, SoleMate uses real-time motion analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict potential falls before they happen. This preventive approach could significantly reduce fall-related injuries and healthcare costs.

### System Capabilities
- **Real-time balance monitoring** at 2Hz with sensor fusion
- **Enhanced fall detection** using multi-stage state machine
- **Posture quality analysis** with tilt angle calculations
- **Baseline calibration** with stability verification
- **Multi-modal feedback** through LED, audio, and display alerts
- **Data logging** with comprehensive movement pattern analysis

## Software Architecture

### Core Application Structure

#### Class Organization
The software is built around three main classes that handle hardware abstraction and intelligent processing:

**1. MPU6050 Class**
- Hardware abstraction for 6-axis motion sensor
- Raw data reading with 16-bit precision
- Automatic sensor validation and error recovery
- Converts raw values to meaningful units (g-force, degrees/second)

**2. LCD1602 Class**
- I2C LCD controller with error handling
- 4-bit communication protocol implementation
- Text positioning and display management
- Graceful degradation when display unavailable

**3. SoleMate Class**
- Main application logic and sensor fusion
- Enhanced fall detection algorithms
- Real-time balance score calculation
- Comprehensive system monitoring

### Algorithm Implementation

#### Baseline Calibration System
```python
def calibrate_baseline(self):
    # 5-second calibration period
    # Requires 60% stable readings (magnitude ≈ 1g)
    # Calculates mean values for X, Y, Z axes
    # Provides foundation for deviation analysis
```

The system establishes a personalized baseline by analyzing 50 readings over 5 seconds, ensuring the user maintains stable posture during calibration.

#### Balance Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_balance_score(self, acc_x, acc_y, acc_z):
    # Calculate deviation from baseline
    # Weight Z-axis (vertical) more heavily
    # Apply non-linear scaling (0-100)
    # Use moving average for smoothing
```

Balance scoring uses weighted deviation analysis where vertical stability (Z-axis) receives double weighting compared to horizontal movements.

#### Enhanced Fall Detection State Machine

**State 1: Normal Operation**
- Monitors for free fall conditions
- Threshold: Total acceleration < 0.5g
- Requires acceleration variance > 0.1 for confirmation

**State 2: Free Fall Detection**
- Monitors for impact within 2-second window
- Multi-factor scoring system:
  - High acceleration (>2.5g): +3 points
  - High rotation (>200°/s): +2 points
  - Vibration trigger: +2 points
  - High variance: +1 point
- Fall confirmed if score ≥ 5 points

**State 3: Impact Recovery**
- 3-second recovery period
- Returns to normal monitoring
- Prevents duplicate alerts

#### Posture Analysis Algorithm
```python
def analyze_posture(self, acc_x, acc_y, acc_z):
    # Calculate pitch and roll angles
    pitch = atan2(acc_x, sqrt(acc_y² + acc_z²)) * 180/π
    roll = atan2(acc_y, acc_z) * 180/π
    
    # Classify posture quality
    # Excellent: <10° tilt
    # Good: <20° tilt  
    # Fair: <30° tilt
    # Poor: ≥30° tilt
```

### Data Management

- **Acceleration History**: 20-sample rolling buffer (2 seconds at 10Hz)
- **Balance History**: 10-sample buffer for smoothing
- **Magnitude History**: Used for variance calculations
- **Memory Efficient**: Fixed-size deques prevent memory leaks

#### Real-time Processing
